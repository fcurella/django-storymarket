Django bindings to the Storymarket API
======================================

This library allows manual or automatic uploaded of Django objects to 
`Stortmarket <http://storymarket.com/>`_.

You'll need a Storymarket account to use this library, and you'll need to
generate an API token by visiting the 
`Developer API page <http://storymarket.com/users/api/>`_.

.. warning::

    Right now this code is very not done. Feel free to play, but there's a
    lot that only kinda-sorta works. Think of it as a pencil sketch that
    I'll be covering over with pen shortly.
