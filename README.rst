Django bindings to the Storymarket API
======================================

This library binds Django models to the `Storymarket API
<http://storymarket.com/api/v1/>`_.

You'll need a Storymarket account to use this library, and you'll need to
generate an API token by visiting the 
`Developer API page <http://storymarket.com/users/api/>`_.

.. warning::

    This library is, at best, of beta quality. It works, but is
    under-tested and -documented, prone to API changes, and likely has
    bugs. At this point in time it should be considered a sketch, not
    a finished work.
