Django bindings to the Storymarket API
======================================

This library allows manual or automatic uploaded of Django objects to 
`Stortmarket <http://storymarket.com/>`_.

You'll need a Storymarket account to use this library, and you'll need to
generate an API token by visiting the 
`Developer API page <http://storymarket.com/users/api/>`_.
